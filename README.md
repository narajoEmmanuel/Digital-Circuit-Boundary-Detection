## Project Overview
The project involves comparing two 4-bit digital data sets to determine which one is greater or if they are equal. One data set comes from an analog sensor connected to an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), extracting its 4 least significant bits. The other data set comes from a 4-bit dip switch, serving as the digital limit.

The comparison checks if the sensor value is less than, equal to, or greater than the limit value. This is accomplished using only CMOS family logic gates. The output activates one of three LEDs: 

- red (value greater than the limit), 
- yellow (value equal to the limit), 
- green (value less than the limit).
